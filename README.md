# JSweet 

A simple project to get started with JSweet. This project just contains a main method that shows 'Hello world' messages in two different ways. The program uses the [J4TS](https://github.com/cincheo/j4ts) candy to access `java.util` API, and the jQuery candy. Programmers can use it to set up a new JSweet project and try out some basic features.

## Usage

```
> git clone https://github.com/lgrignon/jsweet-model-dto-json-deserialization.git
> cd jsweet-model-dto-json-deserialization
> mvn generate-sources
> firefox www/index.html
```
